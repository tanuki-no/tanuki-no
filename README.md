- 👋 Hi, I’m Tanuki and this is definitely a nickname, not the real one.
- 👀 I’m interested in RISC-V, ARM, IoT, HOL, seL4, medical devices and many other stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently not learning because I`m overlearned but I study some practical math, physics and engineering staff for IoT between architecturing, designing, printing, soldering, programming, flashing and testing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on medical devices, MEMS pumps and seL4 drivers.
- 📫 How to reach me: drop me the message in Telegram or letter and I`ll check it out. Russian and English accepted with no translation and are primary for communication.
